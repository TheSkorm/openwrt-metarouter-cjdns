    atm/solos-pci: Don't include frame pseudo-header on transmit hex-dump
    
    Omit pkt_hdr preamble when dumping transmitted packet as hex-dump;
    we can pull this up because the frame has already been sent, and
    dumping it is the last thing we do with it before freeing it.
    
    Also include the size, vpi, and vci in the debug as is done on
    receive.
    
    Use "port" consistently instead of "device" intermittently.

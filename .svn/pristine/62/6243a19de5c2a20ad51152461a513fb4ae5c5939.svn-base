menuconfig PREINITOPT
     bool "Preinit configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
     default n
     help
	These options are used to control the environment used to initialize
	the system before running init (which typically mean /sbin/init which
	switches to multiuser mode).

config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
      bool "Suppress stderr messages during preinit" if PREINITOPT
      default y
      help
	Sends stderr to null during preinit.  This is the default behaviour
	in previous versions of OpenWRT.  This also prevents init process
	itself from displaying stderr, however processes launched by init
	in multiuser through inittab will use the current terminal (e.g.
	the ash shell launched by inittab will display stderr).  That's
	the same behaviour as seen in previous version of OpenWRT.

config TARGET_PREINIT_TIMEOUT
       int
       prompt "Failsafe wait timeout" if PREINITOPT
       default 2

		How long to wait for failsafe mode to be entered before
		continuing with a regular boot if failsafe not selected.
		
config TARGET_PREINIT_SHOW_NETMSG
	bool

	default n
	help
		Show preinit all network messages (via netmsg broadcast), not only
		the message indicating to press reset to enter failsafe.  Note that
		if the architecture doesn't define an interface, and there is no
		'Preinit network interface' defined, then no messages will be
		emitted, even if this is set.
		
config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_FAILSAFE_NETMSG
	bool
	prompt "Suppress network message indicating failsafe" if PREINITOPT
	default n
	help
		If "Show all preinit network messages" above is not set, then
		setting this option suppresses the only message that would be
		emitted otherwise, name the network message to enter failsafe
		(via netmsg).

config TARGET_PREINIT_IFNAME
       string
       prompt "Preinit network interface" if PREINITOPT
       default ""
       help
		Interface for sending preinit messages to network, and any other

		Broadcast address to which to send preinit network messages, as
		as failsafe messages

    default n
    help
	These option choose the command that will run as the 'init' command
	(that is which is responsible for controlling the system once preinit
	transfers control to it) as well as some options controlling its
	behaviour.  Normally init is /sbin/init.

    config TARGET_INIT_PATH
        string
    	prompt "PATH for regular boot" if INITOPT
	default "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin"
	help
		Default PATH used during normal operation

		Should be a space seperated list of variable assignments.  These
		variables will be present in the environment.  Spaces may not be

		The executable to run as the init process.  Is 'exec'd by
		preinit (which is the init that the kernel launches on boot).

    config TARGET_INIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
        bool
        prompt "Suppress stderr messages of init" if INITOPT
        default y
	help
		Prevents showing stderr messages for init command if not already
		suppressed during preinit.  This is the default behaviour in 
		previous versions of OpenWRT.  Removing this does nothing if 
		stderr is suppressed during preinit (which is the default).
